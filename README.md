# Advent of Code 2024

Here's where I'm making this year's attempt. I just can't help myself it seems. 

So here's what I'm going to do! I'll be splitting between Bun for TypeScript and Zig. Usually be doing the Bun one to get the logic right, then seeing what complications arise when I try to do it in zig. I'll keep that up until I get bored of it then we'll see what happens!

I'll post my write-up of the puzzles in the pull requests, so we'll see how that goes!
